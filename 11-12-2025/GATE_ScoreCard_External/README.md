# GATE Score Card - External CSS

This folder contains a recreation of the GATE Score Card that uses an external stylesheet for layout and appearance.

Files:
- `index.html` - The full recreated score card with external stylesheet.
- `styles.css` - The external CSS file with all styles.

How to view:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser by double-clicking it or opening it from the browser.
2. Images are referenced from the `Gate_scorecard_internal` folder to avoid duplicating files. Copy them to this folder if you want `index.html` to be fully self-contained.

Notes:
- The watermark, photos, and signature are implemented similarly to the internal version.
- If you want me to copy assets into this folder or inline images as base64, I can do that too.
