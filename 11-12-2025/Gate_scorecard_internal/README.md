# GATE Score Card - HTML recreation

This folder contains a recreated mockup of the GATE Score Card using HTML and inline CSS.

Files:
- `index.html` — The full recreated score card with inline (internal) CSS. This is self-contained; open it in a browser to preview.

How to view:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser by double-clicking it or using your browser's Open File/Paste file path option.

Notes:
- Images and QR are placeholders implemented using simple SVG blocks in the HTML.
